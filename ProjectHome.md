This project implements a distributed LDA, AD-LDA, using Hadoop MapReduce. It aims to be a easy-to-use and battery-included tool for building and using LDA models.

Besides running on multiple machines, it can also handle very large dataset (larger than main memory) on a single machine, via Hadoop's run-locally mode.
